## "Why is this app broken?"

You know the scene. A SaaS tool that worked yesterday suddenly won't load.
An API returns certificate errors. A specific port times out. Your IT ticket
bounces for three days: *"what's broken?"* → *"the app"* → *"which part?"* →
*"I don't know."*

Meanwhile your browser keeps saying "Connection not secure" and your boss is
asking why the report isn't ready.

**NaruBase™ Probe tells you exactly what's wrong — in the same tab — and
writes the IT ticket for you.**

## In 10 seconds

<img src="logo.png" alt="" width="24" align="left" /> &nbsp; Paste the URL that isn't working.

<img src="logo.png" alt="" width="24" align="left" /> &nbsp; Probe runs the network tests locally.

<img src="logo.png" alt="" width="24" align="left" /> &nbsp; Read the plain-language diagnosis.

<img src="logo.png" alt="" width="24" align="left" /> &nbsp; Click **Copy IT message** — paste into your ticket.

That's it. No expertise required. No cloud service to trust. No data leaves
your machine.

## Three reasons your IT team will approve this

### 🔒 100% local. No exceptions.

No cloud AI. No telemetry. No accounts. **License activation is fully offline**
— verified against an embedded public key, stored in your Windows Credential
Manager. Your diagnostic data — the URLs you test, the certificates you see,
the DNS answers you get — **never leaves your computer**.

The only outbound network request the app makes is an optional version
check against a public GitHub JSON file.

### 📋 Auditable by design

Every diagnosis Probe produces is traceable. One click shows you the exact
rules that matched, with what weights, against what measured values. Your
security team can statically review the entire case database before you
install. Nothing is hidden behind an opaque AI call — because there is no
AI call.

### 💳 One-time purchase. No subscription.

$99 once. You own it. Use it on every computer you own with the same license
key. Pricing tiers for teams and site licenses available on request.

  background monitoring, evidence-bundle PDF export.
- **v2.0** — On-premises update server for air-gapped deployments.

## Frequently asked

**Is my data sent anywhere?**
No. Zero diagnostic data leaves your machine. Zero telemetry. The only
outbound HTTP request is an optional version-check to this public
repository.

**Will it work behind our corporate proxy / firewall / TLS inspection?**
That's exactly what it's built to detect. Probe is designed to tell you
*because* your corporate security is in the path — not *despite* it.

**Does it work offline?**
The diagnosis itself, yes. You need connectivity to whatever target you're
trying to reach, of course. But Probe doesn't call any service of ours to
interpret the result — and license activation is fully offline too.

**How is this different from Wireshark / curl / ping?**
Those tools are for network engineers. Probe is for the other 99% of
employees — the people who have a problem but don't know what a packet is.

**macOS / Linux?**
Windows-first. Other platforms on the longer-term roadmap.

**Is this a rebrand of NaruBase™ Cloud?**
No. [NaruBase™ Cloud](https://github.com/louisbyun/narubase-prod) is a
multi-cloud server management tool. NaruBase™ Probe is a network-diagnostic
tool. Same studio, same brand family, different products.

## Enterprise & team licensing

Per-seat team licensing and site licenses for enterprise deployments are
available. Contact for quotes, pilot agreements, or custom-case ingestion.
